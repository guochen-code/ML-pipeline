data -> data analysis -> feature engineering -> variable selection + machine learning model building -> deployment

data analysis: variable types: numerical/categorical/date/time/mixed/others: dicrete/continuous/nomial/ordinal/text/image
data analysis: variable characteristics: missing data/categorical variables/linear model assumptions/distributions/outliers/feature magnitude

after data analysis, we have a general ideas on feature engineering steps
- feature creation: extracting features from dates/from mixed variables
- missing data imputation
- categorical variable encoding
- numerical variable transformation
- distretisation
- outlier handling
- feature scaling
- others

after above processes, we may end up with a lengthy notebook, which is
- hard to understand
- hard to reproduce
- hard to socre new data
- hard to deploy

so we need feature engineering pipeline

pipeline example:

# train the pipeline
price_pipe.fix(X_train,y_train)

# score data
price_pipe.transform(X_train)
price_pipe.transform(X_test)
price_pipe.transform(live_data
